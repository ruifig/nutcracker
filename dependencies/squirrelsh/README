1. Introduction
---------------
Squirrel Shell is made as a cross platform alternative to system shells like
sh, bash and other in *nix and cmd.exe (command.com) in Microsoft Windows.

Its cross platform nature solves the problem of writing several scripts for
doing the same thing, but in different OS's. This is particularly useful for
writing configuration scripts in source packages.

Squirrel Shell is based on general purpose scripting language "Squirrel". As
this language isn't dedicated to one specific purpose, script authors have
more power. Squirrel has these features:
- object-oriented programming;
- C++-like syntax;
- weak references;
- generators;
- exception handling;
- higher order functions.
