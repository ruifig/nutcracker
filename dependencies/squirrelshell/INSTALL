Squirrel Shell 1.2.7 Installation Instructions
==============================================

This version of Squirrel Shell was tested on these systems:
Linux   - Debian GNU/Linux x86_64 (gcc 4.7.1)
Windows - Windows 7 Professional x64 (Visual C++ 2010 Express)

Unix
----
For pre-compiled version of the shell:
1. Run "sh squirrelsh-1.2.7.run". All required actions will be performed
   automatically.

For pre-compiled distribution-specific packages:
1. Follow instructions for your distribution packages manager.

For source code archive:
1. Unpack archive to a directory accessible during compilation.
   Make sure that directories structure is preserved.
2. Run "./configure" to create makefiles. Run "./configure --help" to see
   information about supported compilation options.
3. If configuration process completed successfully, run "make" to compile
   Squirrel Shell.
4. Run "make install" to install Squirrel Shell on your computer. You may need
   root privileges to perform this step.

Microsoft Windows
-----------------
For pre-compiled version of the shell:
1. Run the installer and follow its instructions.

For source code archive:
1. Unpack archive to a directory accessible during compilation.
   Make sure that directories structure is preserved.
2. Using MinGW makefiles:
   1. Run "mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw" to compile release version of
      Squirrel Shell or "mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw DEBUG=y" to compile
      debug version.
   2. Run "mingw32-make -f Makefile.mingw install" to associate "nut" file
      extension with Squirrel Shell.
      Note: mingw32-make returns current directory with forward slashes as
      path separator and does not allow substitution in the middle of
      variable, so created association may not work as intended.

   Using Visual Studio makefiles:
   1. Run "nmake -f Makefile.msvc" to compile 32-bit release version of
      Squirrel Shell or "nmake -f Makefile.msvc DEBUG=y" to compile 32-bit
      debug version.
      If you have 64-bit AMD or Intel processor and your compiler supports it,
      you can also specify "X64=y" to compile 64-bit version of the shell.
      If you want to use dynamic (DLL) version of run-time library, use the
      "DYNAMIC_CRT=y" option.
   2. Run "nmake -f Makefile.msvc install" to associate "nut" file extension
      with Squirrel Shell.

   Using Visual Studio 2003 project files:
   1. Open "squirrelsh_vs71.sln", select build target and click
      "Build Solution" item in "Build" menu.

   Using Visual Studio 2005 project files:
   1. Open "squirrelsh_vs8.sln", select build target and CPU architecture and click
      "Build Solution" item in "Build" menu.

   Using Visual Studio 2008 project files:
   1. Open "squirrelsh_vs9.sln", select build target and CPU architecture and click
      "Build Solution" item in "Build" menu.

   Using Visual C++ 2010 Express project files:
   1. Open "squirrelsh.sln", select build target and CPU architecture and click
      "Build Solution" item in "Build" menu.
