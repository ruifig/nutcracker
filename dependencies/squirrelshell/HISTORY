             this has broken Windows 9x compatibility.
  - Fixed:   (Windows version only)
             If failed to get the path to user's home directory, "c:" will be

  - Added:   Provided shell and Squirrel version numbers to scripts. These
             values are in 'SHELL_VERSION' and 'SQUIRREL_VERSION' variables,
             respectively.
  - Added:   chmod() function.
  - Added:   chown() function.
  - Added:   chgrp() function.
  - Fixed:   (Windows version only)
             run() function added ".exe" to path even if path already
             contained file extension.
  - Fixed:   Function "platform" was mentioned in functions.txt, but in the
             code it had old name "getos".
  - Changed: Parameter 'mode' in mkdir() and chmod() is a string due to lack
             of octal numbers in Squirrel. This parameter still must contain
             octal permissions, but in text representation:
             mkdir("somedir", "755"),
             chmod("somefile", "664").
